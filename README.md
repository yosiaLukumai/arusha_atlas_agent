## ARUSHA_ATLAS_AGENT – AI Distance & Navigation Agent for Arusha

AI-powered learning project that combines RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), geospatial data, and a small reasoning agent to predict distances between places in Arusha using stored coordinates.

#### This project is built as a hands-on introduction to
=> AI agents
=> RAG pipelines
=> Vector databases
=> Embeddings
=> Geospatial calculations (Haversine)

It’s simple, educational, and perfect for exploring how AI can interact with real-world location data.

### Features
    Stores Arusha common-area coordinates in a vector database
    Retrieves locations using RAG (e.g., “Where is Sakina?”)
    AI agent uses coordinates to compute straight-line distances
    Embeddings for semantic search (e.g., “Njiro Complex” → “Njiro”)
    Modular and beginner-friendly project structure
    Estimate travel time based on simple speed models
